# RESIN Interactive element system

A self-contained interactive element and exercise system used in the textbook for the following purposes:

- Embedding interactive exercises directly into the textbook content.
- Allowing students to manipulate and experiment with interactive elements to enhance their understanding of the material.
- As graded exercises that contribute to the student's overall grade in the course.

## Features
- Support for many elements
- A defined specification - an intermediate representation that is easy to parse, manipulate and platform-agnostic.
- Support for both mobile and desktop platforms.
- Easy scripting with block-based programming (like Scratch).

## Notes

Svelte components used in RESIN are often separate from the main textbook - this is intentional and is implemented to allow for the future separation of RESIN as a standalone library for use in other contexts.
