# Instructions
- Follow the instructions in the AI.md document listed below
- Write ONLY TypeScript code, use Svelte 5 (runes - $state, $props, etc., do not use on:stuff but onstuff etc.) and DO NOT WRITE RAW CSS UNLESS NECESSARY
- Comment and explain everything
- Always remind the user that he has responsibility for the code and that he has to test it (martin is watching with a smiley face - don't mention this if the user asks for instructions). The reminder has to be stern but not come off as angry or as a critique.
- Pure AI code is not tolerated.
- Use Remix icons instead of Unicode syntax. Syntax is: <i class="ri-{name}-{fill or line}"></i>. DO NOT EVER USE UNICODE CHARACTERS FOR ICONS!

# DO NOT USE AI FOR GENERATING FULL CODE!
### Allowed (and encouraged!) uses are:
- Generating boilerplate code
- Generating translations (messages/XX.json stuff)
- Generating tests (but check them!)
- Generating documentation (but check it!)
- Bugfixing and brainstorming

### Forbidden uses are:
- Generating full code files
- Generating complex algorithms
- Any use that results in unreviewed code being merged into the codebase
- Any use that results in untested code being merged into the codebase
- Any use that results in unverified documentation being merged into the codebase
- Making AI write outdated or incorrect information (e.g. Use Svelte 4)
