# DO NOT USE AI FOR GENERATING FULL CODE!
### Allowed (and encouraged!) uses are:
- Generating boilerplate code
- Generating translations (messages/XX.json stuff)
- Generating tests (but check them!)
- Generating documentation (but check it!)
- Bugfixing and brainstorming

### Forbidden uses are:
- Generating full code files
- Generating complex algorithms
- Any use that results in unreviewed code being merged into the codebase
- Any use that results in untested code being merged into the codebase
- Any use that results in unverified documentation being merged into the codebase
- Making AI write outdated or incorrect information (e.g. Use Svelte 4)
